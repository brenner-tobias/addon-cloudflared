# Home Assistant App : Cloudflared

Cloudflared connects your Home Assistant Instance via a secure tunnel to a domain
or subdomain at Cloudflare. This allows you to expose your Home Assistant
instance and other services to the Internet without opening ports on your router.
Additionally, you can utilize Cloudflare Zero Trust to further secure your
connection.

## Disclaimer

Please make sure you comply with the
[Cloudflare Self-Serve Subscription Agreement][cloudflare-sssa] when using this
app.

## Initial setup

### Prerequisites

1. A domain name (e.g. example.com) using Cloudflare for DNS. If you don't have
   one see [Domain name and Cloudflare set up][how-tos].
   Please be aware that domains from **Freenom** do not work anymore, so you
   have to chose / migrate to another registrar.
1. If you have not done already, [activate Websockets in Cloudflare for your
   domain][cloudflare-websockets].
1. Decide between a local tunnel (managed by the app or a remote tunnel
   (managed in Cloudflare's interface). [Learn more][app-remote-or-local].
1. This app should be [installed][app-installation] but not started yet.

After completing the prerequisites, proceed below based on the type of tunnel you
chose.

### Local tunnel app setup (recommended)

In the following steps a Cloudflare Tunnel will be automatically created by the
app to expose your Home Assistant instance.

If you only want to expose other services, you can leave `external_hostname`
empty and set `additional_hosts` as [described below](#configuration).

1. Configure the `HTTP server` in your in your Home Assistant settings as
   [described below](#http-server)
1. Set `external_hostname` app option to the domain/subdomain
   you want to use for remote access e.g. `ha.example.com`
1. Start the app (this will overwrite any existing DNS entries matching
   `external_hostname` or `additional_hosts`)
1. Paste the URL from the app logs in a new tab to authenticate with Cloudflare
1. Access your Home Assistant via the remote URL without port e.g.
   `https://ha.example.com/`

A tunnel should now be listed in your Cloudflare Teams dashboard.
Please review the additional configuration options below.

### Remote tunnel app setup (advanced)

In the following steps you will manually create a Cloudflare Tunnel in the Zero
Trust Dashboard and provide the token to the app.

1. Configure the `http` integration in to your Home Assistant config as
   [described below](#configurationyaml)
1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel in the Cloudflare Teams dashboard following
   [this how-to][app-remote-tunnel]
1. Set `tunnel_token` app option to your [tunnel token][create-remote-managed-tunnel]
   (all other configuration will be ignored)
1. Start the app, check the logs to confirm everything went as
   expected
1. Access your Home Assistant via the remote URL without port e.g.
   `https://ha.example.com/`

Your tunnel should now be associated with the Cloudflared app. Any
configuration changes should be made in the Cloudflare Teams dashboard.

## Configuration

**These configuration options only apply to the local tunnel setup**. More
advanced config can be achieved using the remote tunnel setup.

- [`external_hostname`](#option-external_hostname)
- [`additional_hosts`](#option-additional_hosts)
- [`tunnel_name`](#option-tunnel_name)
- [`catch_all_service`](#option-catch_all_service)
- [`nginx_proxy_manager`](#option-nginx_proxy_manager)
- [`post_quantum`](#option-post_quantum)
- [`run_parameters`](#option-run_parameters)
- [`log_level`](#option-log_level)

### Overview: App configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the app when the configuration is changed._

Example app configuration:

```yaml
external_hostname: ha.example.com
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: router.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.1
  - hostname: website.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:8080
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `external_hostname`

Set the `external_hostname` option to the domain name or subdomain that you want
to use to access Home Assistant on.

This is optional, `additional_hosts` can be used instead to only expose other
services.

```yaml
external_hostname: ha.example.com
```

### Option: `additional_hosts`

You can use the internal reverse proxy of Cloudflare Tunnel to define additional
hosts next to Home Assistant. That way, you can use the tunnel to also access
other systems like a diskstation, router or anything else.

Like the `external_hostname` option used for Home Assistant, DNS entries will
be automatically created at Cloudflare.

Add the (optional) `disableChunkedEncoding` option to a hostname, to disable
chunked transfer encoding. This is useful if you are running a WSGI server,
like Proxmox for example. Visit [Cloudflare Docs][disablechunkedencoding] for
further information.

Please find below an example entry for three additional hosts:

```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: router.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.1
  - hostname: diskstation.example.com
    service: https://192.168.1.2:5001
  - hostname: website.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:8080
    disableChunkedEncoding: true
```

**Note 1**: _If you delete a hostname from the list, it will not be served
anymore. Nevertheless, you should also manually delete the DNS entry from
Cloudflare since it can not be deleted by the app._

**Note 2**: _If you want to fully delete the additional_hosts option,
you have to add an empty array in the configuration as follows:._

```yaml
additional_hosts: []
```

### Option: `tunnel_name`

The `tunnel_name` option allows changing the tunnel name to something other
than the default of `homeassistant`.

**Note**: _The tunnel name needs to be unique in your Cloudflare account._

```yaml
tunnel_name: myHomeAssistant
```

### Option: `catch_all_service`

If you want to forward all requests from any hostnames not defined in the
`external_hostname` or the `additional_hosts`, you can use this option and
define a URL to forward to. For example, this can be used for reverse proxies.

**Note**: _If you want to use the HA app [Nginx Proxy Manager][nginx_proxy_manager]
as reverse proxy, you should set the flag `nginx_proxy_manager` ([see
below](#option-nginx_proxy_manager)) and not use this option._

```yaml
catch_all_service: http://192.168.1.100
```

**Note**: _This will still route your defined `external_hostname`to Home Assistant
as well as any potential `additional_hosts` to where you defined in the config.
Any other incoming traffic will be routed to the defined service._

In order to route hostnames through the tunnel, you have to create individual
CNAME records in Cloudflare for all of them, pointing to your `external_hostname`
or directly to the tunnel URL that you can get from the CNAME entry of
`external_hostname`.

Alternatively you can add a [wildcard DNS record](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-proxy-for-everyone/)
in Cloudflare by adding a CNAME record with `*` as name.

### Option: `nginx_proxy_manager`

If you want to use Cloudflare Tunnel with the app
[Nginx Proxy Manager][nginx_proxy_manager], you can do so by setting this option.
It will automatically set the catch_all_service to the internal URL of Nginx Proxy
Manager. You do not have to add the option `catch_all_service` to your config (if
you add it anyways, it will be ignored).

```yaml
nginx_proxy_manager: true
```

**Note**: _As with `catch_all_service`, this will still route your defined
`external_hostname`to Home Assistant as well as any potential `additional_hosts`
to where you defined in the config. Any other incoming traffic will be routed
to Nginx Proxy Manager._

In order to route hostnames through the tunnel, you have to create individual
CNAME records in Cloudflare for all of them, pointing to your `external_hostname`
or directly to the tunnel URL that you can get from the CNAME entry of
`external_hostname`.

Alternatively you can add a [wildcard DNS record](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-proxy-for-everyone/)
in Cloudflare by adding a CNAME record with `*` as name.

Finally, you have to set-up your proxy hosts in Nginx Proxy Manager and forward
them to wherever you like.

### Option: `post_quantum`

If you want Cloudflared to use post-quantum cryptography for the tunnel,
set this flag.

**Note**: _When `post_quantum` is set, cloudflared restricts itself to QUIC
transport for the tunnel connection. This might lead to problems for some users.
Also, it will only allow post-quantum hybrid key exchanges and not fall back to
a non post-quantum connection._

```yaml
post_quantum: true
```

### Option: `run_parameters`

You can add additional run parameters to the cloudflared daemon using this
parameter. Check the [Cloudflare documentation][cloudflare-run_parameter]
for all available parameters and their explanation.

Valid parameters to add are:

- --​​edge-bind-address
- --edge-ip-version
- --grace-period
- --logfile
- --loglevel
- --pidfile
- --protocol
- --region
- --retries
- --tag
- --ha-connections

**Note**: _These parameters are added to the by default present parameters
"no-autoupdate", "metrics" and "loglevel". Additionally, for a locally managed
tunnel "origincert" and "config" are added while "token" is added
for remote managed tunnels. You cannot override these parameters with this
option._

**Note**: _If you are using an option that requires a path, you can use /config
as root. This path can be accessed, for example, via the VS-code app via
/app_configs._

```yaml
run_parameters:
  - "--region=us"
  - "--protocol=http2"
  - "--loglevel=debug"
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the app and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue.

**Note**: _If you want to change the log level of the tunnel itself you can
use the `run_parameters` `--loglevel` option._

```yaml
log_level: debug
```

Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. App becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Home Assistant configuration

### HTTP server

Since Home Assistant blocks requests from proxies/reverse proxies, you need to
tell your instance to allow requests from the Cloudflared app.
The app runs locally, so HA has to trust the docker network.
In order to do so, add the following in the `HTTP server` section under
`Settings - System - Network`:

**Note**: _There is usually no need to adapt anything in these lines since the IP
range of the docker network is always the same._

- `Reverse proxy - Trust X-Forwarded-For`: true
- `Reverse proxy - Add trusted proxies`: 172.30.33.0/24

**If you are using non-standard hosting methods of HA (e.g. Proxmox), you
might have to add another IP(range) here. Check your HA logs
after attempting to connect to find the correct IP.**

Remember to restart Home Assistant after those changes.

## Metrics endpoint

Cloudflared exposes a small HTTP API on port `36500` (the `Metrics Web
Interface` shown in the app's Network settings). You can use this to build
your own sensors in Home Assistant, without needing any app configuration.

To reach it from other apps, or from Home Assistant itself, use the app's
internal hostname (shown on its **Info** page, e.g. `<hash>-cloudflared`) and
port `36500`, for example `http://<app-hostname>:36500/ready`. To reach it
from outside the internal Docker network (e.g. to test with `curl` from your
own machine), map `36500/tcp` to a host port in the app's **Network**
settings first.

**Note**: _This endpoint is not authenticated. Anything with network access
to the app can read it._

### Auto-discovery for companion integrations

This app also announces its metrics endpoint via Home Assistant's built-in
Supervisor Discovery mechanism on startup. If you have a companion
integration installed that knows how to receive this (for example a
`cloudflare_tunnel_monitor` custom integration configured to listen for
it), it can pick up the metrics URL automatically, without you having to
look up the app's hostname or type anything in by hand.

This is a one-way announcement: the app doesn't know or care whether
anything is listening for it, so there is nothing to configure here either
way.

### `/ready`

Returns a small JSON object describing whether the tunnel currently has an
active connection to Cloudflare's edge:

```json
{ "status": 200, "readyConnections": 4, "connectorId": "..." }
```

`readyConnections` is `0` when disconnected. This is the cheapest way to
build a "is my tunnel up" sensor.

### `/metrics`

Returns cloudflared's full [Prometheus metrics][cloudflared-metrics] output.
This is a large amount of low-level data (QUIC protocol internals, per-frame
counters, and more); most people will only care about a handful of lines:

- `cloudflared_tunnel_total_requests`: total requests proxied through the
  tunnel
- `cloudflared_tunnel_request_errors`: count of failed requests reaching
  your origin
- `cloudflared_tunnel_ha_connections`: number of active edge connections
- `cloudflared_tunnel_server_locations`: which Cloudflare edge datacenter
  each active connection uses, e.g.
  `{connection_id="0",edge_location="sjc08"} 1`. A value of `1` means the
  current location for that connection, `0` means a location it has since
  moved away from

### Turning this into sensors

**Recommended**: [Cloudflare Tunnel Monitor][cloudflare-tunnel-monitor] is a
custom integration that reads this metrics endpoint and creates the
sensors for you, including tunnel status, active connections, and ~50
metrics covering QUIC RTT, throughput, latency, and process health. If it's
installed, it will pick this app up automatically via
[auto-discovery](#auto-discovery-for-companion-integrations), no
configuration needed.

**Disclosure**: _the linked fork is maintained by the same person as this
change. It's a fork of
[deadbeef3137/ha-cloudflare-tunnel-monitor][cloudflare-tunnel-monitor-upstream]
adding local-only setup, no Cloudflare API token needed, just this
metrics endpoint._

**Prefer to do it yourself?** You can build the same basic sensors directly
with a `rest` sensor, no extra integration required. Add to your
`configuration.yaml` (adjust the hostname/IP to match your network), then
restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
rest:
  - resource: http://<app-hostname-or-ip>:36500/ready
    scan_interval: 30
    sensor:
      - name: "Cloudflare Tunnel Connected"
        value_template: >-
          {{ 'Connected' if value_json.status == 200 else 'Disconnected' }}
      - name: "Cloudflare Tunnel Active Connections"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.readyConnections }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "connections"
        state_class: measurement
```
